# Machine Learning Algorithms in Banking
One of the big uses of machine learning techniques can be found in the banking sector, especially for making predictions.
This project presents an introduction to machine learning using the programming language R, specifically to the following models:
1. Random Forest 
2. Boosting 
3. Naive Bayes  


The data is pre-processed to deal with missing values and any imbalancement.
Once the data is cleansed, a predictive program is built on the loan default for applicants based on several parameters.
The results of the three approaches were all close to 80% accuracy.
